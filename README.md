# Microsoft Studios Needs Analysis
Author: Luca Francesco Caruccio

## Overview

This project analyzes film data from imdb and other sources based on genre, ratings, and release dates to provide accurate data analyses for Microsoft Studios. Descriptive analysis of the variable data shows certain genres have more favorable ratings and/or greater ROI than others, and certain months have proven to be far more profitable than others. Budgets have also been analyzed to show the most favorable investment range. Microsoft Studios can use this data to plan their first motion picture, using the correct release dates, genre types, and budget set ups.

## Business Problems
Microsoft Studios is currently reviewing their options for a new film, and are looking for information that can help them make the right decision on which film, and several technical specifications. They may be able to narrow down their options across several categories, and possibly even commit to a film that meets the conclusion criteria. The main questions include: When should the film be released, which genre should the film be, and how much money should we invest?

## Data

imdb has a number of files with relational movie data, that can be combined and reformatted to analyze specific trends across a number of variables.

## Methods

This project will use descriptive analysis to group the available data according to the specific variables suggested in the business problems column.

## Results

Animation, Adventure, and Musicals tend to do the best across both rating and profit. The best months to release films are June, May, and November. The ideal production budget should fall between 100-200 million, to ensure healthy profis an minimize risks.

### Conclusions
This Analysis leads to three key conclusions regarding Microsoft Studios' new project:

1. Animation, Adventure, and Musicals are he most reliably successful genres through both rating and profit. Pick a film that falls under any combination of the three.
2. Investing between 1-200 million on a production budget protects a studioâ€™s profits while also minimizing the risk of any losses, so I would recommend choosing or financing a film with a budget in that range.
3. Release dates for the film should prioritize the months of June, May, and November, in respective order of profit increase.


### Next Steps

Deeper Analysis could further assist the Studios decisions:

1.Investigating ROI by percentage returned rather than gross value
2.Analyze monthly Profits by genre to find the best potential matches for release dates and specific movies
3.Lastly finding successful partners who have proven to have comparable impacts as the data solutions available so far, you know, which directors, which actors, which studios if you were to consider a joint venture.
