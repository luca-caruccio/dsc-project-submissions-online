# Microsoft Studios Needs Analysis
Author: Luca Francesco Caruccio

## Overview

This project analyzes film data from imdb and other sources based on genre, ratings, and release dates to provide accurate data analyses for Microsoft Studios. Descriptive analysis of the variable data shows certain genres have more favorable ratings and/or greater ROI than others, and certain months have proven to be far more profitable than others. Budgets have also been analyzed to show the most favorable investment range. Microsoft Studios can use this data to plan their first motion picture, using the correct release dates, genre types, and budget set ups.

## Data

You will be able to:

* Create project deliverables that meet Flatiron School requirements
* Submit your project deliverables in Canvas
* Prepare for your project review

## Methods

**Reach out to an instructor immediately via Slack to let them know you've started your project and schedule your project review.** If you're not sure who to schedule with, please ask in your cohort channel in Slack.

## Results

Complete the deliverables for your project, guided by the rubric at the bottom of the main project assignment. Keep in mind that the audience for these deliverables is not only your teacher, but also potential employers. Employers will look at your project deliverables to evaluate multiple skills, including coding, modeling, communication, and domain knowledge. You will want to polish these as much as you can, both during the course and afterwards.

### Conclusions

Your GitHub repository is the public-facing version of your project that your instructors and potential employers will see - make it as accessible as you can. At a minimum, it should contain all your project files and a README.md file that summarizes your project and helps visitors navigate the repository.

### Next Steps

Your Jupyter Notebook is the primary source of information about your analysis. At a minimum, it should contain or import all of the code used in your project and walk the reader through your project from start to finish. You may choose to use multiple Jupyter Notebooks in your project, but you should have one that provides a full project overview as a point of entry for visitors.

### For More Information

Your non-technical presentation is your opportunity to communicate clearly and concisely about your project and it's real-world relevance. The target audience should be people with limited technical knowledge who may be interested in leveraging your project. We recommend using Google Slides, PowerPoint or Keynote to create your presentation slides. You will then record yourself delivering the presentation.
